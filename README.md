# To-Do Application

To practice my CSS3 and Front-End Development skills, I created a simple To-Do List Application using Google Fonts and CSS Animation. The application was created to easily add and delete your tasks you need to accomplish. The application does not save your tasks when you close your browser.

## Technologies Used
HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, and Node.js.
